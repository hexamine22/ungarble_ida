IDA 9.0 plugin for decrypting strings encrypted by garble.

## Description:
This plugin attempts to decrypt strings encrypted by the Garble Obfuscator's literal obfuscation (https://github.com/burrowers/garble). It primarily targets the latest hardened literals obfuscation (see: https://github.com/burrowers/garble/commit/d47e0761eb51dedbce86a4f142ab45154f46adb1).
cpeter's project was a great help in understanding the different types of literal obfuscation:

The plugin has been tested on Windows and Linux binaries (x86 and x64), and it was able to recover all the strings (430+ in main) from the binaries.
When you run the script, some errors are expected due to false positives, these can be safely ignored. The script also takes a bit of time to run (usually 2â€“3 minutes), due to multiple linear sweeps.

There may still be bugs, as this is very experimental.
Patching the decrypted strings is not yet implemented, but it will be soon.
Usage : File -> Script file... -> Select this script.
